Hello!

This is my version of youtube. I'm creating it using React, axios, styled components and Youtube API. Project is still in progress, but It's working. At this moment I'm focused at styling this web app.


How to run this app: 

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure You have npm and node installed on your computer('npm -v' and 'node --version' in terminal)
3. Install node modules from dependecies(npm install)
4. Run the app(npm start)
5. Have fun!
