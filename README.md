Hello!

This is my version of youtube. I'm creating it using React, axios, styled components and Youtube API. Project is still in progress, but It's working. At this moment I'm focused at styling this web app.


How to run this app: 

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure You have npm and nodejs installed on your computer(You can check it using 'npm -v' and 'node --version' commands      in terminal)
3. Install node modules from dependecies(npm install in terminal)
4. Generate your Youtube API key and paste it into object property named as key in /APIs/youtube.js
4. Run the app(npm start)
5. Have fun!
